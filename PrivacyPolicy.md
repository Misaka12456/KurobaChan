User Rights Under the GDPR, users have the following rights regarding their personal data:

- Right to Access: Users can request access to the information stored by the Application.
- Right to Rectification: Users can request corrections to any inaccurate or incomplete information.
- Right to Erasure: Users can request the deletion of their information from the Application.
- Right to Restrict Processing: Users can request limitations on how their information is processed.
- Right to Data Portability: Users can request a copy of their information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
- Right to Object: Users can object to the processing of their information under certain circumstances.
