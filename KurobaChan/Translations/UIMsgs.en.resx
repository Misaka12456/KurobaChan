The wizard will help you to add a new external program to database, which window can be hidden and shown by KurobaChan.

If you're ready, click "Next".

Note: It is required to start the target program at least once for necessary information to be collected during wizard process.
If you want to add a program that is not suitable to start in current environment (e.g. adding NSFW game in work environment), please close this wizard and wait for appropriate time to start again.</value>

        <value>Locale Emulator is a tool that can run programs with different code page from current system's global code page by simulating region/language's code page environment.
It is required to use Locale Emulator to run program with different code page (e.g. running native Japanese program with Shift-JIS(932) code page in Simplified Chinese environment).
You need to download the tool here: https://github.com/xupefei/Locale-Emulator

If you need to use Locale Emulator to run this program, to prevent misjudging program's main window, you need to enable "Support for Locale Emulator".
If your program does not need to use Locale Emulator, it is not recommended to enable this option.</value>
